FAQs on AI replacing human software engineers

## [Are all software engineers going to be replaced by AI?](#all-replace)

No. People working on specialized software that are out of distribution (OOD) or don't conform to typical software patterns (OS kernels, DBMS, aircraft control, oil refinery management) are safe from AI because AI don't have enough knowledge on how to work on them.

People working on mission-critical software like aircraft control or medical devices will probably be safe as there are strict regulations and less room for error.

## [Where do we get the senior software engineers if junior engineers are replaced?](#where-senior)

The same way we have always been: through companies hiring, and self-learning.

Large companies may continue to hire and train junior software engineers (in reduced numbers) to:
- make sure they have a pipeline for senior software engineers in case things go wrong
- fufill the social responsibilities of ensuring there are humans to pass down the knowledge (Captain B. McCrea in WALL-E)

Plenty of people will continue to learn programming on their own (with the help of AI) and become good at it.
