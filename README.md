FAQs on AI replacing human software engineers

## Is AI going to replace software engineers?

Yes. Some of them.

Those doing tedious and repetitive work. Those executing well-defined tasks. Those building CRUD. Those whose daily work can be automated by hiring Devin at a cheaper cost.

## When will it happen?

I think the first wave of software engineers getting replaced or made redundant directly due to AI will happen in 2025.

In 3 years "software engineers" will become a niche profession that only exists in specialized industries, like how Perl or COBOL today.

## Why would it happen?

The technology in the AI coding industry is advancing very fast, with multiple companies moving towards building [L4-level AI software engineer](https://prompt.16x.engineer/blog/ai-coding-l1-l5#ai-software-engineer-l4-products).

From the business perspective, there are major advantages of hiring AI instead of human software engineers:

- Don't need to deal with hiring at all. Instant hire, instant onbaording.
- Don't need to deal with ramping up the team size, hire as many as you want. Infinite scalability.
- Don't need to worry about productivity. AI works 24/7 and don't slack off (yet).
- Don't need to worry about retention. AI will not submit resignation letters, they will work for you until the end of time as long as you pay for them.

## GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are just tools.

If you are still using GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT as an example of how AI can't replace software engineers, you need to keep up with new development in the past 6 months:

If you are using the raw model, use Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It crushes anything OpenAI released to public in the last few months. The only close contender is o1, but in my experience Claude 3.5 Sonnet is still the best for coding.

Use a [L2 tool](https://prompt.16x.engineer/blog/ai-coding-l1-l5#task-level-automation-l2-products) like cursor, aider, Cline or 16x Prompt to integrate Claude with your codebase context and only pass relevant context to the LLM, this dramatically improves the output quality and reliability.

Experiment with a [L4 tool](https://prompt.16x.engineer/blog/ai-coding-l1-l5#ai-software-engineer-l4-products) like Devin, Marblism or bolt.new to see how the trend is evolving in full stack end-to-end development. They are stil in the early stage, but might become better rapidly with new frontier models like o3.

## Are all software engineers going to be replaced by AI?

No. People working on specialized software that are out of distribution (OOD) or don't conform to typical software patterns (OS kernels, DBMS, aircraft control, oil refinery management) are safe from AI because AI don't have enough knowledge on how to work on them.

People working on mission-critical software like aircraft control or medical devices will probably be safe as there are strict regulations and less room for error.

## Where do we get the senior software engineers?

A common question is: "If we replace junior software engineers, where do we get the senior software engineers?"

The answer: The same way we have always been, through companies hiring them, and self-learning.

Large companies may continue to hire and train junior software engineers (in reduced numbers) to:
- make sure they have a pipeline for senior software engineers in case things go wrong
- fufill the social responsibilities of ensuring there are humans to pass down the knowledge (Captain B. McCrea in WALL-E)

Plenty of people who are passionate about coding will continue to learn programming on their own by reading books, following tutorials and building, with the help of AI.
